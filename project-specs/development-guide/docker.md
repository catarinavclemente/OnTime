### Detaching Without Stopping <a href="#detaching-without-stopping" id="detaching-without-stopping"></a>

Docker supports a keyboard combination to gracefully detach from a container. Press Ctrl-P, followed by Ctrl-Q, to detach from your connection.

Youâ€™ll be dropped back into your shell but the previously attached process will remain alive, keeping your container running. You can check this by using `docker ps` to get a list of running containers.
