# 🐞 Troubleshooting



#### <mark style="color:red;">Failed loading /usr/lib64/php/modules/xdebug.so: /usr/lib64/php/modules/xdebug.so: undefined symbol: gc\_globals</mark>

In GNU/Linux systems derived from modern Red Hat releases (such as RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS), the PHP distribution may be divided into the primary .ini file residing at `/etc/php.ini` as well as a collection of other .ini files specific to extensions or packages installed as RPMs residing in `/etc/php.d`. At initialization, PHP will read `/etc/php.d/*.ini` after loading the main `php.ini` file.

It would seem that you have a stale file containing Xdebug settings residing in `/etc/php.d`. Grep for Xdebug in `/etc/php.d` to find the offender and remove it or comment out the relevant lines.

```bash
grep xdebug /etc/php.d/*.ini
```

If Xdebug was installed separately by a manual process and you manually modified the main `/etc/php.ini` to load the extension and configure its settings, that would explain why Xdebug otherwise works while you still see errors about its nonexistence at `/usr/lib/php/modules/xdebug.so`. This also could have happened if configuration files from `/etc` were copied from an old 32bit system to a 64bit system wherein modules reside at `/usr/lib64/php/modules`
